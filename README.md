# Git Deep Dive Part 2

This repo is more focused on git commands, their flags, and GitHub functions used in team development like:
- fork
- clone
- pull requests from a fork
- reflog
- file recovery with reflog and hashes, or using merge
- merge conflicts
- checkout (--ours, --theirs)
- rebase conflicts
- squashing
- stash (list, pop, apply, drop, -m)
- revert
- diff
- cherry-pick
- bisect (start, good, bad, reset, run)
- worktree (add, remove, prune)
- tag (-a, -m)

Git Deep Dive Part 1 focuses on solo development unless I find a way to merge the two repos without losing commits.
